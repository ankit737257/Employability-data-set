# **Employability Prediction Dataset - README**

## **Overview**
This dataset has been created to support research on employability prediction using machine learning models. It includes data on graduates' skills, recruiter ratings, and company feedback on placed students. The dataset can be used to develop predictive models to assess employability based on academic and soft skills.

## **Dataset Contents**
The dataset consists of three major tables:

### **1. Graduate Employability Dataset**
| Column Name         | Description                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Graduate_ID       | Unique identifier for each graduate            |
| Aptitude         | Aptitude test scores (out of 100)               |
| Communication    | Communication skills scores (out of 100)       |
| Technical       | Technical skills scores (out of 100)           |
| Personality     | Personality assessment scores (out of 100)     |
| Placement_Outcome | Placement status (Placed/Not Placed)           |

### **2. Recruiter Data**
| Column Name        | Description                                    |
